= Neo4j & LM Studio Fundamentals

This repository is based on the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-fundamentals/[Neo4j & Generative AI Fundamentals course^] on link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com[GraphAcademy^], but modified to use LM Studio instead of OpenAI.

*LM Studio Migration*: This project demonstrates how to use link:https://lmstudio.ai[LM Studio^] with its native Python SDK for local AI inference, providing excellent macOS compatibility and user-friendly model management.

Original course: link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-fundamentals/[enrol now^]

== LM Studio Setup

Before running the examples, you need to set up LM Studio:

. *Download and install LM Studio*:
   - Visit link:https://lmstudio.ai[LM Studio website^]
   - Download the desktop application for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Install and launch the application

. *Download required models*:
   Using LM Studio GUI or CLI:
+
[source,sh]
----
# Install LM Studio CLI
brew install lmstudio  # macOS
# or download from https://lmstudio.ai/docs/cli

# Download recommended models
lms get llama-3.2-1b-instruct
lms get text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5
----

. *Load models in LM Studio*:
   - Open LM Studio desktop app
   - Load the chat model: `llama-3.2-1b-instruct`
   - Load the embedding model: `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`

. *Verify LM Studio is ready*:
   - Ensure the desktop app is running
   - Models should be loaded and ready for inference

== Setup and Tests

To run the solution tests: 

. Create Neo4j instance with the `recommendations` dataset
. Run the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/courses/blob/main/asciidoc/courses/genai-fundamentals/modules/2-rag/lessons/3-vector-index/reset.cypher[Cypher to add embeddings and create the vector index^].
. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements.
+ 
[source,sh]
pip install -r requirements.txt
. Install `pytest`
+
[source,sh]
pip install pytest
. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Use `.env.example` as a template.
. *Test the environment* (including LM Studio connection):
+
[source,sh]
python genai-fundamentals/test_environment.py
. Run the tests
+
[source,sh]
pytest genai-fundamentals/solutions

== Key Differences from Original

* *LM Studio Integration*: Uses LM Studio's native Python SDK for local inference
* *No API Keys Required*: Direct integration with LM Studio desktop application
* *Excellent macOS Support*: Native Apple Silicon optimization and compatibility
* *User-Friendly Setup*: GUI-based model management and configuration
* *Privacy-First*: All data processing happens locally with LM Studio
* *Offline Capable*: Works without internet connectivity once models are downloaded
